  - name: Iron Terror (1/Day; 4th-Level Spell). 
    desc: "Avalla projects a terrify- ing illusion of the High Command to each enemy in a 30-foot cone. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 21 (6d6) psychic damage and be frightened of each member of the High Command for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn)."
  - name: Iron Shackles (1/Day; 3rd-Level Spell; Concentration)
    desc: "Avalla conjures animated iron chains at a point she can see on the ground within 60 feet of her. The chains fill a 15-foot- square on the ground centered on that point and last for 1 minute. When a creature enters that area for the first time on a turn or starts their turn there, they must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained (save ends at start of turn). A creature restrained in this way takes 7 (2d6) bludgeon- ing damage at the end of each of their turns."

    desc: "If not in the Cyst, Avalla teleports to the Cyst. If in the Cyst, she teleports to a place she has visited. "
reactions:
  - name: Escape Ring
    desc: When Avalla isn't in the Cyst and an ally she can see within 60 feet of her drops to 0 hit points, she expends a use of Iron Ring and teleports herself to the Cyst along with each willing ally within 60 feet of her who isn't incapacitated.
  - name: Spellcasting Feedback
    desc: When a creature Avalla can see within 60 feet of her casts a spell, she taps into the caster's mind and sabotages their magic. The creature can choose either to cast the spell then take 3 (1d6) psychic damage per level of the spell cast, or to let the spell fail. If the spell fails, the creature's spell slot is expended with no effect and their action is wasted.
