The PCs can learn more about the hags in Vallaki. Rictavio, Ezmerelda, Urwin Martikov, or a book in Baron Vallakovich’s library (DC 15 Investigation check) can give the party information on the history and interests of night hags (should the coven reveal their true forms, or hint at their true nature); their damage resistances; their haunting ability; and the heartstone and soul bag.

An Intelligence (Arcana) check can allow any PC to attempt to recall information about night hags. This information is gained at the following DCs:

DC 15: Night hags are demonic creatures of nightmares. Like other hags, they can form covens with exactly two other hags, which vastly increases their power.

DC 20: Night hags thrive on corruption and fear. They are tempters and dealmakers, and consume the souls of evildoers for pleasure and nourishment. Their skin is hardened against elemental forces, and they fear no mortal metal save silver. So long as the members of a hag coven remain nearby to one another, their arcane power is greatly increased.

DC 25: A night hag is said to have passage through the Ethereal Plane, slipping away into the realm of spirits to better haunt her prey. It is said that the touch of a night hag from the Border Ethereal can torment her victim with terrible nightmares and exhaustion. Night hags are fond of devouring children, and must do so to produce their foul offspring.

DC 30: A night hag keeps two artifacts that are precious to her. One is a heartstone - a lustrous black gem allows a night hag to become ethereal while it is in her possession. The touch of a heartstone also cures any disease. The second is a soul bag. When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a night hag's haunting, the hag catches the soul in a black sack made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. 

The PCs can also learn more about the hags in Vallaki. Rudolph van Richten knows all the information in the above table, while Ezmerelda knows all of the information up to DC 25. A book in Baron Vallakovich’s library (Intelligence (Investigation) DC 15) can be found that contains all information up to DC 20 of the table, while Urwin Martikov knows the information at DC 15.
