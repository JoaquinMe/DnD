Se aparece en los sueños de [[Sek'Kuar]]. Quiere que lo liberen.

1. Si liberan a Zhudun, tienen un free use of [[true-resurrection|True Resurrection]].
2. Apenas lo liberan, su personaje gana una flaw: "I view death as a non-permanent state. When I will it I will resurrect any deceased being to serve my ends"
3. The PC can still use Resurrection when they want. But each following usage will have a cost - first a life for a life, then two for one, then three for one etc. There are conditions to be met:
4. the victim should not be old or sick
5. the PC must be the one to deliver the killing “blow”, bringing the victim to 0hp
6. the PC must cut their own hand and paint three vertical lines with their blood on the victim’s forehead as a dedication to Zhudun. In my game Zhudun has five eyes, so it is mostly for flavour


The kill can be done beforehand (on deposit, huh) or no later than 7 days after the Resurrection.

1. After the first kill Zhudun considers PC their champion and urges PC to built them a shrine/altar. I had a ritual for that, but at the end decided to give autonomy to the players. Basically they must desecrate a place by performing some hideous/terrible act (like a mass killing).
2. If the PC does it, their alignment will change to Evil.

There is also a system of boons that the PC can get after they build the shrine, but all of them are at the expense of their teammates or NPCs (anyone nearby).

It works amazingly so far. The PC has agreed with the team’s Paladin to kill only “bad people”. The “bad people” are determined by the Paladin. So far they have sacrificed one Vistani (there was time-pressure for the kill) and Lady Wachter. They are looking for a second victim to add to Lady Wachter and return St. Andral to life.
