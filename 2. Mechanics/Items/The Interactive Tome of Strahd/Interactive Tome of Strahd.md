# Reglas del Tomo
- Once the attuned creature has decided to investigate a chapter–if it is successfully decoded–they are forcefully absorbed into the pages of the book along with any other creature within 30 feet.
- The first chapter has already been decoded by Rudolph van Richten and will absorb the readers instantly when it is opened for the first time after it has been attuned to. 
- If the creature attuned to the Tome dies, a creature friendly to them may attune to it and refer to their companion's shorthand to resume the translation.
- Time moves differently inside the pages of the Tome. Exploring a single chapter takes 1 hour of time in addition to the 4 hours spent on research and deciphering the text.
- While inside of the Tome, doors not connected to rooms relevant to the current events open to the Mists of Ravenloft.
- Non-magical items found in a chapter can be brought back to the present. Magical items taken from the memories of the Tome lose any magical properties if returned to the present. (See the Fortunes and Futures sidebar below for a possible exception for this rule).
- Any damage taken while in a chapter is sustained when a creature leaves. If a creature dies within the chapter, their body must be carried to the end of the chapter's events or it is lost to the pages of history.
- Any creatures exploring the chapters are referred to by their names, but illusory visages relevant to the events in that chapter mask their appearance so that they blend in. See each chapter for the related illusions. These illusions cannot be dispelled.
- Events are recorded on the pages as they occur. The attuned creature–and any creatures friendly to them–may read the documented events again but cannot re-enter a previously decoded chapter.
- The written version of the events unfold precisely as they occurred in the adventure but are written from Strahd’s perspective. Although creatures exploring the memories are referred to by name, their names are altered in the written version of the events that reflect the true moment. This way, any choices made in “the past” are always the correct version of history.
