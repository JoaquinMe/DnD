# Earth Tremor
*1st-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You cause a tremor in the ground within range. Each creature other than you in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `1d6` bludgeoning damage and is knocked [prone](z_compendium/rules/conditions.md#prone). If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until cleared, with each 5-foot-diameter portion requiring at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

**Classes**: [Bard](z_compendium/classes/bard.md), [Druid](z_compendium/classes/druid.md), [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](z_compendium/classes/fighter-eldritch-knight.md), [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](z_compendium/classes/rogue-arcane-trickster.md), [Sorcerer](z_compendium/classes/sorcerer.md), [Wizard](z_compendium/classes/wizard.md)
