# Protection from Evil and Good
*1st-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be [charmed](z_compendium/rules/conditions.md#charmed), [frightened](z_compendium/rules/conditions.md#frightened), or possessed by them. If the target is already [charmed](z_compendium/rules/conditions.md#charmed), [frightened](z_compendium/rules/conditions.md#frightened), or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.

**Classes**: [Cleric](z_compendium/classes/cleric.md), [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](z_compendium/classes/fighter-eldritch-knight.md), [Paladin (Oath of Devotion)](z_compendium/classes/paladin-oath-of-devotion.md), [Paladin](z_compendium/classes/paladin.md), [Ranger (Horizon Walker)](z_compendium/classes/ranger-horizon-walker-xge.md), [Ranger (Monster Slayer)](z_compendium/classes/ranger-monster-slayer-xge.md), [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](z_compendium/classes/rogue-arcane-trickster.md), [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](z_compendium/classes/sorcerer-divine-soul-xge.md), [Warlock](z_compendium/classes/warlock.md), [Wizard](z_compendium/classes/wizard.md)
