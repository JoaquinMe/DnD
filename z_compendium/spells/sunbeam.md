# Sunbeam
*6th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-feet line)
- **Components:** V, S, a magnifying glass
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `6d8` radiant damage and is [blinded](z_compendium/rules/conditions.md#blinded) until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't [blinded](z_compendium/rules/conditions.md#blinded) by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.

You can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until the spell ends.

For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.

**Classes**: [Cleric (Arcana Domain)](z_compendium/classes/cleric-arcana-domain-scag.md), [Druid](z_compendium/classes/druid.md), [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](z_compendium/classes/sorcerer-divine-soul-xge.md), [Sorcerer](z_compendium/classes/sorcerer.md), [Wizard](z_compendium/classes/wizard.md)
