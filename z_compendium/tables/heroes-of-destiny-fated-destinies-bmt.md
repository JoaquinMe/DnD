**Fated Destinies**

| 1d22 | Heroic Tie |
|------|------------|
| 1 | You were trained by an organization that opposes a deity or another powerful cosmic force. |
| 2 | You were born under a sign associated with cataclysm, and every attempt to glimpse your future reveals ill omens. |
| 3 | A religious organization imprisoned you, perhaps because of a crime you committed against that faith or because the leaders considered you the servant of a rival power. |
| 4 | You or your family are watched by secretive figures. They usually keep hidden, but you've seen they wear an unknown symbol. |
| 5 | You made a choice in your past that haunts you. Whatever the consequences, it's not clear you made the right choice. |
| 6 | A powerful figure opposed to your beliefs vexes your life; even your triumphs seem to serve this being's ends. |
| 7 | What could have been one of the happiest moments in your life turned into a tragedy. |
| 8 | You inherited land containing the ruins of a temple where a coveted relic was hidden. |
| 9 | You were brought up to believe in a prophecy of impending doom, but you perceive potential and hope where others expect disaster. |
| 10 | An inflexible person with power over you threatened to bring about disaster, but your decisive action prevailed. |
| 11 | The defenders of a religious organization such as a druid circle, paladin order, or temple watch over you. |
| 12 | You are most comfortable at night, and all your greatest successes have taken place then. You also bear a silvery, crescent-shaped birthmark. |
| 13 | Your studies led you to a scrap of prophecy or the memoir of a prominent figure, which calls your beliefs into question. |
| 14 | A devout individual whom you looked up to revealed themself to be false, a disciple of a power opposed to your beliefs. |
| 15 | You were once a favored adherent of a religious order, but you've been cast out in disgrace. |
| 16 | An otherworldly being whispers advice to you in dreams or visitations, taking on different guises and speaking through others. |
| 17 | You were returned to life through resurrection magic, divine intervention, or a mysterious circumstance you don't yet understand. |
| 18 | When you adopted your current beliefs, your life changed dramatically for the better. |
| 19 | While you never placed much stock in the beliefs you were taught, adhering to them saved you from a catastrophe. |
| 20 | You have a well-used holy symbol from someone you looked up to, and you feel uncertain anytime you're without it. |
| 21 | You were born to a family of divinely favored folk, and they have big expectations for you. |
| 22 | Your soul, or a loved one's, is doomed to be taken by a Fiend, a powerful Undead, or another wicked power. |
