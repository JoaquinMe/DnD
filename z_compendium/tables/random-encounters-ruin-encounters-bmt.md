**Ruin Encounters**

| 1d12 | Encounter |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | Animals—such as a [brown bear](z_compendium/bestiary/beast/brown-bear.md), [giant owl](z_compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-owl.md), or pack of `2d6` [wolves](z_compendium/bestiary/beast/wolf.md)—attack, made vicious by the effect of Baphomet's temple deep under the hill. |
| 2 | `2d4` [minotaur archaeologists](z_compendium/bestiary/humanoid/minotaur-archaeologist-bmt.md) explore the hill, looking for artifacts and places to dig. |
| 3 | `1d6` [minotaur infiltrators](z_compendium/bestiary/humanoid/minotaur-infiltrator-bmt.md) are performing a bloody rite to Baphomet; if there are six, one is their leader, [Brusipha](z_compendium/bestiary/npc/brusipha-bmt.md) (both stat blocks appear in this chapter). If discovered, the minotaurs attack to conceal their activity from outsiders. |
| 4 | `1d3` [displacer beasts](z_compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/displacer-beast.md), pets of the green hags, are on the prowl; alternatively, use [yeth hounds](z_compendium/bestiary/fey/yeth-hound-mpmm.md) from "Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse". |
| 5 | A plaintive howl echoes over the hill. Characters who succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](z_compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check identify the source as the collapsed bell tower in the Feygrove, where a young [displacer beast](z_compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/displacer-beast.md) is trapped. |
| 6 | A [green hag](z_compendium/bestiary/fey/green-hag.md) from the coven hidden in the Feygrove is on a mysterious errand. If she detects the adventurers before they spot her, the hag uses Illusory Appearance to conceal herself as a dryad and invites the characters to the Feygrove, then returns to her coven and sets a trap for the characters. |
| 7 | Vegetation on the hillside has grown into a hedge maze due to the magical influence of Baphomet's temple. Navigating the maze requires 1 hour and a successful DC 18 Wisdom ([Survival](z_compendium/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check. |
| 8 | Mekkalath's presence prompts a fiery eruption. Creatures in a 5-foot-radius, 20-foot-high cylinder must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 17 (`5d6`) fire damage. |
| 9 | `1d3` [fire elementals](z_compendium/bestiary/elemental/fire-elemental.md) drawn from the Elemental Plane of Fire by Mekkalath's aura wander the hill. |
| 10 | Spiders from the Feygrove are on the prowl; they include `2d4` [giant spiders](z_compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-spider.md) plus either `1d3` [phase spiders](z_compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/phase-spider.md) or 1 [ruin spider](z_compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/ruin-spider-bmt.md) (see "chapter 21"). |
| 11 | A lone [githyanki warrior](z_compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-warrior.md) hunts for tonight's meal. |
| 12 | A [red slaad](z_compendium/bestiary/aberration/red-slaad.md), dropped here by the comet that recently overflew the site, searches the hill for any way to lift the wards around the watchtower. |
